# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the networking program that you wrote. Describe how to use your software.  If you did Client/Server, then you will need to describe how to start both.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Network Communication

{Describe the architecture that you used (client/server or peer-to-peer)}

{Identify if you are using TCP or UDP and what port numbers are used.}

{Identify the format of messages being sent between the client and server or the messages sent between two peers.}

# Development Environment

This project was developed using VS code on Mac. 
I am using python version 3.10.11 with the standard python library 'socket'.
During testing I would run the server through the computer's terminal and the 
client from the terminal within VS code.
This should run on any computer with python installed.
